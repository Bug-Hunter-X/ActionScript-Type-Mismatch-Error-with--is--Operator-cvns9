# ActionScript Type Mismatch Error with 'is' Operator

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error related to type mismatches when using the `is` operator. The error arises from unexpected type coercion or dynamic typing, leading to incorrect type checking.

## Bug Description

The ActionScript code attempts to check the type of an object using the `is` operator. However, due to unexpected type coercion or dynamic typing, the type check fails, resulting in a type mismatch error.

## Bug Reproduction Steps

1. Compile and run the `bug.as` file.
2. Observe the type mismatch error reported by the compiler or runtime environment.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the types of objects passed to the function. Adding explicit type checks or using more robust type handling mechanisms, such as `try...catch` blocks, can prevent this type of error.

The `bugSolution.as` file demonstrates a corrected version of the code that addresses the type mismatch issue.
